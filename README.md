### Travelers:
As a traveler simply sign up with a user account and browse or search through a long list of experiences. Select a trip and get in contact with trip organizers to plan your next adventure.
### Trip Organizers:
If you want to host tours you can sign up as an organizer. As an organizer you will be able to create, update, edit or delete travel experiences. Once completed, your experiences will be posted to the database and available to travelers. Travels will be able to search locations to find your experience and, if theyâ€™re interested in yours, they can save your experience in a wish list. Travelers will contact you if they decide to go on your trip!
